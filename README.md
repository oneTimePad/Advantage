# Advantage
A TensorFlow-based Reinforcement Learning Framework. Allows for easy deployment of various RL algorithms with a little amount of coding. This framework is compatable with OpenAI Gym. Users can develop simulators using OpenAI Gym, and then simply using configuration files, train their models in the simulator. Trained models can then be easily deployed using TensorFlow protobufs.
